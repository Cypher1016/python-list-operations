# Python List Operations Exercise

A hands-on demonstration of fundamental list operations in Python, showcasing:
- List creation and modification
- Common methods like `append()`, `insert()`, and `extend()`
- Sorting and index operations

## 🛠️ Operations Demonstrated
1. Created empty list
2. Appended multiple elements
3. Inserted element at specific position
4. Extended with another list
5. Removed last element
6. Sorted in ascending order
7. Found index of specific value

## 💻 Code Example
```python
my_list = []
my_list.append(10)
my_list.append(20)
# ... full implementation ...
print("Index of 30:", my_list.index(30))
Index of 30: 3
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
